## About Me

My name is Roman, I am 28 years old, my goal for the last year is to study and put into practice frontend development skills.

At the moment I am working in a sports IT startup, making up landing pages and multi-page sites.

I don't have enough practice in using JS, so lately I've been devoting almost all my free time to training.

I try to stick to this quote:

> The one who does nothing is not mistaken. Don't be afraid to make mistakes â€” be afraid to repeat mistakes.
