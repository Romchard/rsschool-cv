## About Me

My name is Roman, I am 28 years old, my goal for the last year is to study and put into practice frontend development skills.

At the moment I am working in a sports IT startup, making up landing pages and multi-page sites.

I don't have enough practice in using JS, so lately I've been devoting almost all my free time to training.

I try to stick to this quote:

> The one who does nothing is not mistaken. Don't be afraid to make mistakes â€” be afraid to repeat mistakes.

## Code example

> Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each. If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.
>
> Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.

```
function lovefunc(flower1, flower2){
  // moment of truth
  return (flower1 % 2 == 0 && flower2 % 2 !== 0)|| (flower1 % 2 !== 0 && flower2 % 2 == 0) ? true : false
}
```
